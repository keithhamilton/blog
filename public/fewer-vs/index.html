<hr>

<p>I've been reading a lot of essays on the "correctness" of Standard English lately, and I've been waffling on the idea. In some regards, it seems perfectly correct that there is a standard set of grammar rules, and that they can be violated. In other regards, one must ask, "How do those rules get made in the first place?"</p>

<p>Take "fewer" versus "less." If we go by Standard English, this is a mistake you will hear and/or make every day. The rule goes like this:</p>

<h4 id="foracollectionofthingsifthethingcanbecountedusefewerotherwiseuseless">For a collection of things, if the "thing" can be counted, use <em>"fewer,"</em> otherwise use <em>"less."</em></h4>

<p>So, for example, would you ever say "I have 15 clothing"? No, so if you got rid of some clothing, you would say "I have <strong><em>less</em></strong> clothing than I used to have."</p>

<p>Might you ever say "I have 25 apples"? Yes, you might say that. If you ate three apples, you would then say "I have <strong><em>fewer</em></strong> apples than I used to have."</p>

<p>This is the "correct" way to say something is in a smaller quantity than something else. My question now is "why?" It's clear that just using "less" all of the time doesn't conflate meaning; if it did, no one would make this mistake in general. You would never say "I have more apples" just after losing a few.</p>

<p>Some argue that because something is said in general it is inherently correct. I'm still now sure where I stand on that, but this idea hinges on the original question: </p>

<h2 id="howdorulesofgrammargetmadeinthefirstplace">How do rules of grammar get made in the first place?</h2>

<p>I don't mean "what authority" or "what group," I mean whatever body decides what the rules are...where does it get its information? It seems preposterous that a group of people would sit around in a room and just fabricate rules based on fancy. What seems more reasonable is that the group of people who "decide" what standard language is are taking general usage and trying to fabricate rules that describe it.</p>

<p>If "general usage" is the north star for the group of grammarians who codify our language, then <em>we,</em> the entire body of speakers, are the ones who make the rules. This is not to say that anything is correct, rather that if it's generally spoken, it is correct.</p>

<p>So, is it incorrect to say "I have less apples than I had yesterday"? Yes. For now.</p>
