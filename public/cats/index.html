            <p>I live in urban Portland, and I want to talk briefly about a really shitty part about living in an urban environment. </p>

<hr>

<p>My wife and I have a dog. We moved into our neighborhood almost six years ago, and immediately had to build a fence around the yard, so that our dog wouldn't be able to run willy-nilly around the 'hood. This is a given—no one, us included, would even take a second-thought at this.</p>

<p>So, Bailey, our half-sized, perpetually shagrinned, loving dog, is confined to the house or the yard, or she is on a leash. In short, she is a prisoner, but one we take very good care of and love very much.</p>

<p>I understand that some people aren't dog people. That's fine; it is, in part, the reason for having fences (apart from the obvious problem that dogs have big mouths, full of pointy teeth, and can bite fairly hard). True story: on the third day of living in our house, our next-door neighbor wrote and deposited a letter in our mailbox, informing us of our dog's ill behavior of barking incessantly. He threatened us with legal action if we didn't rectify the barking situation immediately. </p>

<p>Frustrated, but ultimately on the wrong side of the law, we decided to install a dog door, so that Bailey could go outside to evacuate, but could remain inside. As we had hoped, our house proved to be sufficient in deadening her barking that we received no further complaints.</p>

<p>The point I'm trying to emphasize here is that, as dog owners, we are implictly responsible to our neighbors. We have a duty and an obligation to ensure that our dog doesn't pollute their air space with her barking, doesn't pollute their yards with her poop, and is properly fenced in lest she run out and bite someone.</p>

<p>And now we've come to it. My dog is not the point of this post. Your cat is.</p>

<p>Sure. Cats are funny. Cats are cute, sometimes. GIFs of cats are especially great. The problem is, however, cats are much more of a nuisance than they are a benefit to urban society. To be clear, I'm speaking of "outdoor" cats.</p>

<p>As a dog owner, I have an implicit responsibility to my neighborhood. Not so for cat owners, whose wards tend to spend as much time shitting in my garden and destroying my plants as they do in their owners yards.</p>

<h6 id="pointblankitisfuckingdisgustingtohavetodigyourcatsshitoutofourgardenbedsicantbelieveitsevenlegalforyoutohaveacat">Point blank, it is <em>fucking disgusting</em> to have to dig your cats' shit out of our garden beds; I can't believe it's even legal for you to have a cat.</h6>

<p>Indoor cats are cool, because they shit in their owners' houses, apartments, duplexes, and condos. Outdoor cats shit in <strong><em>my</em></strong> yard. </p>

<p>Indoor cats are cool, because they chew up their owners' house plants, which their owners are responsible for replacing. Outdoor cats chew up my fucking garden plants, and I am responsible for replacing them.</p>

<p>Indoor cats are cool, because they kill nothing, save the catnip rodent toy they love to hunt after and murder, each day, endlessly, like some kind of Matrix-come-to-life. Outdoor cats kill animals and leave them in my yard, as if in some kind of tribute to my generosity for letting them hunt my land.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that if you own a cat, and let it roam the outdoors in an urban environment, you are being a dick. Straight up. You are not taking responsiblity for an animal that doesn't give a turd for its actions, and will take what it wants, from whom it wants, and will shit on that person after the fact.</p>

<p>If I haven't been clear thus far, let me be so: I don't hate cats. I just hate your cats, in my yard. But, because it's a <em>cat</em> and not a dog, it gets some sort of societal pass to do whatever the fuck it pleases. </p>

<p>If you own an outdoor cat, do yourself a favor, and go ask your neighbors how it pleases them to pick up cat poop from their yards. Ask them how many plants they've had to replace. Ask them what they did with the dead rodents found in their yard, adorning the Japanese Maple to which they so lovingly tend.</p>

<p>Ask them that, then ask yourself if your cat shouldn't be wearing a shock collar that strongly encourages it to not leave <strong><em>your</em></strong> yard.</p>

<p>I take care of my pet, and I protect her from doing stupid shit around the neighborhood. It's high time cat owners do the same.</p>
